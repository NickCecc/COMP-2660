;State three main differences when summing an array with Java or C and summing it within assembly. What do you think about the performance?
;Java is much easier and less code-heavy than assembly
Java memory is very easy to work with and has garbage collection. Assembly all the memory must be assignmend and accessed manually
Java has error recognition and will provide suggestions, assembly will not.
Assembly will be faster if implemented properly and efficiently.

4. What is the benefit of using a register to dereference an array element? Are there any other suggestions?
Beneficial due to the fast access times of the cpu registers compared to accessing main memory
